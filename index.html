He is portrayed by Vin Diesel and first appeared on film, alongside fellow character Brian O'Conner, in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Dominic was created by screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson, who was inspired by an article on street racing that was published in the May 1998 issue of Vibe magazine, while Diesel was heavily sought after to play the character. Dominic acts as an influential voice, being forced into the role as primary caregiver following his father's untimely passing. As the leader, he initially worked as an auto mechanic, but eventually progressed to orchestrating carjackings, a multi-million dollar heist, and illicit jobs for government agencies. He is described as being Gruff, strong, believes in morals and loyalty and also a big family guy. One thing to know about him is that YOU DON’T PLAY WITH HIS FAMILY BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH HIM.. AND YOU DON’T WANT THAT.
